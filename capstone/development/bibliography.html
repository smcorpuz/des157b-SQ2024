            <h2>Working to Address the Loneliness Epidemic: Perspective-Taking, Presence, and Self-Disclosure</h2>
            <p class="author">By Marissa King</p>
            <p class="cite">
                King M. Working to Address the Loneliness Epidemic: Perspective-Taking, Presence, and Self-Disclosure. American Journal of Health Promotion. 2018;32(5):1315-1317. doi:10.1177/0890117118776735c</p>
            <p>This source explains how dangerous lonliness can be by providing statisical evidence of health complications to make their claim more reliable; they focus more so on how this impacts the workplace. The second half of the article discusses how managers can foster social support by emphasizing self-disclosure, being present, and working to improve social connections. Overall, the author explains how lonliness is detrimental to the workplace and gives general solutions on how to tackle the issue.</p>
            <p>This source is useful to my project since it emphasizes the harmful impacts of lonliness. In addition, it gives tips on how an individual may be able to combat this issue. However, since it focuses on a workplace perspecitve, it should not 100% be used for my project since I will be utitlizing a community lens. </p>

            <h2>Our vanishing third spaces</h2>
            <p class="author">Ray Oldenburg</p>
            <p class="cite">Oldenburg, Ray. "Our vanishing third places." Planning commissioners journal 25.4 (1997): 6-10.</p>
            <p>This source talks about what a third space is and how these sort of places have begun to vanish after World War II. They then explain their main reasons as to why third spaces are so important. Each different point supports how third spaces contribute to having a larger, healthier community. It curves the lonliness problem and makes it easier for individuals in a single area to get to know each other. In addition, these spaces provide stress relief from work and being cooped up alone in one's home. Overall, the author explains how the lack of third spaces in America hurts the country's overall sense of community.</p>
            <p>This source is useful to my project since it provides information of what a third space is along with facts as to why they're so important to the aspect of community. I will utilize this information by incorporating how third spaces contributes to a bigger feeling of community which will curve the lonliness problem.</p>

            <h2>We Have Put Individualism Ahead of the Common Good for Too Long</h2>
            <p class="author">Richard Weissboard & Chris Murphy</p>
            <p class="cite">Weissbourd, Richard, and Chris Murphy. “How Government Can Help Americans Find the Common Good Again.” Time, Time, 11 Apr. 2023, time.com/6269091/individualism-ahead-of-the-common-good-for-too-long/. </p>
            <p>This source talks about how the individualism culture in America has gotten far too extreme and is harming our sense of community. People in general are far too focused on their own self-interests and think of others as a second thought; their peers and even friends are not their main priority. In addition, there has been a lack of local community and businsess due to large corporations buying up propetty everywhere. Overall, the author argues that the government should enact laws that promote community and connection to foster a more collective mindset; America needs to find a healthy balance between individualism and collectivism again.</p>
            <p>This source is useful to my project since it highlights the issue of individualism in the country. It explains how individualism has led to a lack of community but it is due to the way our infrastucure is built; there are no walkable communities and a lot of public spaces are gradually becoming less local. If there are more local spaces and assistance by the government to fund social programming, there would be a greater sense of community, thus less lonliness</p>
